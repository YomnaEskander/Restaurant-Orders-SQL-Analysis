# Restaurant-Orders-SQL-Analysis

Welcome! This project explores and visualizes restaurant order data using **MySQL** and **Power BI**. It's designed to simulate real business insights that a restaurant owner or analyst might need.

---

## Overview

I analyzed two key tables:

- **menu_items**: Contains dish names, categories, and prices
- **order_details**: Tracks customer orders over time

The goal was to uncover valuable business insights — top-selling items, customer spending, pricing trends, and more — then visualize them in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Questions Answered

### Menu Insights:
- How many items are on the menu?
- What are the most and least expensive dishes?
- How many dishes are in each category?
- What’s the average price per category?

### Order Insights:
- What is the total number of orders and items sold?
- Which orders had the most items?
- Which menu items are ordered the most and least?
- What categories generate the most revenue?
- Which orders spent the most?
